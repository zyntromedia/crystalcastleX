Here’s a **Release PR template** to standardize version bumps, changelogs, and deployment notes, plus the updated config so contributors can select it directly.

```

### 🔑 Behavior
- Contributors now see **twelve options**: Feature, Bugfix, Docs, CI/CD, Refactor, Security, Performance, Test, Chore, Style, Release, and Default.  
- This ensures release management PRs are standardized, with explicit versioning and deployment validation steps.

Would you like me to also add a **Hotfix PR template** (e.g., `hotfix.md`) for urgent production fixes that bypass normal release cycles?
