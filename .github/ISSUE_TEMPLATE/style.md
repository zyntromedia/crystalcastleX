Here’s a **Style PR template** for cosmetic changes like linting, formatting, or UI polish, plus the updated config so contributors can select it directly.

### 🔑 Behavior
- Contributors now see **eleven options**: Feature, Bugfix, Docs, CI/CD, Refactor, Security, Performance, Test, Chore, Style, and Default.  
- This ensures purely cosmetic/style changes are tracked separately, avoiding clutter in functional PR reviews.

Would you like me to also add a **Release PR template** (e.g., `release.md`) for version bumps, changelogs, and deployment notes? That way, release management PRs are standardized too.
