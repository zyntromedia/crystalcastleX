### 📄 `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/config.yml`

```yaml
blank_issues_enabled: false

pull_request_templates:
  - name: "Feature PR"
    path: "PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/feature.md"
    description: "Use this for new features, enhancements, or major changes."
  - name: "Bugfix PR"
    path: "PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/bugfix.md"
    description: "Use this for bug fixes, patches, or regressions."
  - name: "Docs PR"
    path: "PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/docs.md"
    description: "Use this for documentation-only changes."
  - name: "CI/CD PR"
    path: "PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/ci-cd.md"
    description: "Use this for workflow, pipeline, or infra changes."
  - name: "Refactor PR"
    path: "PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/refactor.md"
    description: "Use this for code cleanups, restructuring, or optimizations."
  - name: "Security PR"
    path: "PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/security.md"
    description: "Use this for vulnerability fixes, dependency upgrades, or hardening changes."
  - name: "Default PR"
    path: "PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/default.md"
    description: "General template for other changes (infra, misc)."
```

### 🔑 Behavior
- Contributors now see **seven options**: Feature, Bugfix, Docs, CI/CD, Refactor, Security, and Default.  
- This ensures security-related PRs are tracked separately, with explicit checklists for compliance and vulnerability validation.

Would you like me to also add a **Performance PR template** (e.g., `performance.md`) so optimizations and scalability improvements don’t get mixed into refactors?
