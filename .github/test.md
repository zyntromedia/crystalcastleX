### 🔑 Behavior
- Contributors now see **nine options**: Feature, Bugfix, Docs, CI/CD, Refactor, Security, Performance, Test, and Default.  
- This ensures test‑related PRs are tracked separately, with explicit coverage and validation steps.

Would you like me to also add a **Chore PR template** (e.g., `chore.md`) for dependency bumps, config tweaks, or housekeeping tasks that don’t fit into feature/bugfix/security?
